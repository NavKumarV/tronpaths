# tronpaths
This is a game created in HTML canvas and JavaScript where 3 users move forward with leaving the track behind, and if the user touches the path then his complete path will be erased, the last one left is the winner.

This game is an extension and improvement of the old snake game.

In the above 2 html flies, Tron3 is a 3 players game where 3 users can play in one system.

In the Tron3_AI only one user can play and the other 2 paths act as a bot with some Artificial intelligence.
